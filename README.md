I have re-used code from a lot of online resources, the three most significant ones being :-
1. [This](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) blogpost by the creator of keras - Francois Chollet.
2. [This](https://github.com/heuritech/convnets-keras) project by Heuritech, which has implemented the AlexNet architecture.
3. [here](https://rahulduggal2608.wordpress.com/2017/04/02/alexnet-in-keras/) blogpost by Rahul Duggal.
